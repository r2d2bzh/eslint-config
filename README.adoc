= ESLINT-CONFIG

The r2d2bzh product stack is composed of multiple NodeJS micro-services.
They need to be written with the same eslint rules thus the need to https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs[share these rules] in order to avoid developers to maintain them in each project.

== Current set of rules

The current set of rules provided by this shared configuration follows:

[source,js]
----
include::./index.js[tag=rules]
----

== Install

You need to add the following NPM development dependency to the project that needs to be checked:

`npm install --save-dev eslint @r2d2bzh/eslint-config#<VERSION>`

NOTE: Replace `<VERSION>` with a git tag of the https://github.com/r2d2bzh/eslint-config/releases[`eslint-config` repository].

This will add the package `eslint-config` in your repo.

In order to instruct eslint to apply these rules, you need to create an `eslintrc.js` file close to the `package.json` file:

.eslintrc.js
[source,js]
----
import { defineConfig } from 'eslint/config';
import r2d2bzhEslintConfig from '@r2d2bzh/eslint-config';

export default defineConfig([
  {
    extends: [r2d2bzhEslintConfig],
  },
]);
----

WARNING: This package has peer dependencies that you need to install manually.
This is to follow https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs#publishing-a-shareable-config[eslint recommendations].

== Ensuring linting

To ensure that the eslint rules are followed, the current recommendation is to add `husky` and `lint-staged` to the project:

`npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged`

.package.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "eslint-staged": {
    "*.js": ["eslint"]
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  }
}
----
